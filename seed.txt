IGNORE THIS, I GOT SOME ERROR WHEN MIGRATING TWO DATBASES

ERROR WAS LIKE THIS

https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4571

I THINK THIS ERROR HAPPENS WHEN YOU USE MIGRATE WITH YOUR STAGING DATBASE, AND THEN WITH YOUR DEV DATBASE

SHADOW DATBASES THEN GOT MIXED OR HAVE SOME CONFLICTS

I THINK YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WIPE CLEAN STAGING DATABASE

DATBASE MIGRATION WILL RUNN SEEDING ALSO

**I THINK WHEN YOU WANT TO USE PRODUCTION YOU SHOULD REMOVE THAT SEEDING OPTION INSIDE package.json**

THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR US SO FOR NOW TILL WE FOUND BETTER SOLUTION

COMMENT OUT (TEMPORRARY REMOVE) THIS LINE

```
"prisma": {
  "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
},
```

FROM package.json

IF YOU WANT TO USE STAGING DATABASE

NOW IT IS SAFE TO MIGRATE: SAFE TO RUN `yarn prisma:migrate:prod` AND YOU WON'T GET ERRORS
