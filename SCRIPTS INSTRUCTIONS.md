# TESTING

- TEST WITHOUT POSTGRES DATABASE, AND TEST IN WATCH MODE

`yarn test`

**WITH DATBASE**

- TEST WITH ONLY PUSHING SCHEMA (WITHOUT SEEDING)

`yarn pg:test`

- TEST WITH SEEDING TO THE DATBASE

`yarn pg:test:seed`

I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE FOR TESTING

***

**IMPORTANT: IF CONTAINER WITH DATBASE IS STILL LIVE EVEN TEST FINISHED, TRY STOPING IT FIRST WITH:**

`docker-compose down`

IF THAT DOESN;T WORK TRY: `docker kill <name of cont>`

***

# DEVELOPMENT

START DEVELOPMENT WITH SEEDED POSGRESS INSTANCE

`yarn d`

THE REST YOU CAN FIGURE IT ON YOUR OWN

`yarn dev` IS JUST NEXTJS APP

**KEEP IN MIND THAT IF YOU STOP DEVELOPMENT SERVER, CONTAINER OF DATBASE IS STILL LIVE (YOU CAN KILL IT WITH docker kill (OR CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT JUST EXECUTE yarn dev AND YOU ARE CONNECTED TO YOUR DATBASE))**

**READ SCRIPTS FOR THE REST OF THE STUFF**

# STAGING

I LIKE TO CALL IT STAGING BUT ENVOLVES VARS WE LOADED FROM `.ev.production`

WE CONNECT TO OUR CLOUD DATBASE WITH THOSE SCRIPTS
